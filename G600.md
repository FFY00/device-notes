# Physical description

The Logitech G600 has a lot of buttons: there is a keypad of 12 buttons
under the left thumb.

# Profiles

Looks like there are 2 types of profiles:

- those stored in flash: they are somewhat limited as you can not use
  macro keys.
- the one in RAM: macro keys are available, but there is no persistent
  state.
