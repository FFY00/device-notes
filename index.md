# Devices notes gathered from the libratbag project

This site keeps tracks of the various features of the devices we are supporting
in libratbag.

It does not contain protocol information for legal reasons.
Please keep it to only general observations and public data (like the number of
supported profiles, the DPI capabilities, the number of buttons, etc...).

can not support those devices in libratbag.
